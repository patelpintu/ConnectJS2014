# Sample code referenced during my talk in Ti-Connect Atlanta 2014


Here's the code I referenced in my [slides](https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/ConnectJS2015.git) for [ConnectJS Atlanta 2014](http://connect-js.com/).

## TabGroup
There's nothing really exciting in this example.  It's the same TabGroup example that comes with Titanium, but using the **Require** tag for the content.

## ActionBar Spinner
Expands on the concept of using Alloy to create platform-specific containers, keeping reusability of cross-platform views.  This example uses the [ActionBarExtras](https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/actionbarextras) module to expose the ActionBar Spinner to Titanium.

## Cross-Platform Template
IfThis is an empty template app to implement platform-specific containers in Alloy.
